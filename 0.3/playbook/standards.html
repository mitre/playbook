      <h2>Health Data Standards provide the Common Language for Better Health</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Health data standards help patients, health systems, payers, researchers and others who need to work together communicate using a common language. Health data standards can specify clearly how data are collected, stored, shared, and/or used such that every piece of data can be unambiguously understood by all entities within the health ecosystem. Widely-adopted standards enable semantic interoperability across people, systems, and processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standards are not the end product, from the perspective of this Playbook. Standards are an essential means to the end goal of enpowering accurate, electronic sharing of data needed to improve health care and access, and to reduce burden and costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best standards are demanded by product consumers; community-driven and developed within an open, royalty-free standards organization; often suggested or mandated by the Government; well documented; demonstrated to provide value; easy to implement in systems and workflows; and adopted by and across the community.
      </p>
      <h3>CodeX / mCODE Standards Development Tutorial</h3>
      <p>
        The following is an excellent 2 hour and 33 minute video by May Terry (key mCODE author) that provides a deep dive into the strategy and process employed to develop the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE">mCODE FHIR IG standard</a> standard for oncology. This strategy and approach should be applicable across health specialties. Selected points from the video are summarized in text and graphics on the rest of this page.

      <h3>Key Organizations and Foundational Standards</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/">Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)</a> is the “principal federal entity charged with coordination of nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health information technology and the electronic exchange of health information”. ONC spearheads assembling community agreement on a “standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange”, called the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a>. ONC also coordinates the <a href="https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdi">USCDI+<a> initiative, which supports domain or program-specific data element lists that operate as extensions to the existing USCDI. The mCODE team is coordinating closely with the USCDI+ cancer domain team.
      </p>
      <p>
        ONC has increasingly partnered with <a href="https://www.hl7.org/">Health Level Seven (HL7)</a>, the preeminent organization for gathering communities to develop standards that enable health data interoperability. Of the many important efforts within HL7, two are foundational for the work described in this Playbook: <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a> and <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR Implementation Guide</a>. Both are further explained below.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Standards Development Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The following graphic illustrates key steps that are necessary and/or useful in developing and publishing a quality, HL7 standard, FHIR Implementation Guide. This process is agile (thus the cycles representing steps), with iterations and interactions between each cycle.
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="../images/fhir-ig-process.png" width="100%" class="py-5" alt="Diagram of FHIR IG process from clinical concept to HL7 standard" /></p>

      <br>
      <p>
        Next, the broad topics from the graphic above are broken down and discussed in greater detail: (a) Clinical Requirements, (b) FHIR IG Development, and (c) HL7 Standardization.
      </p>
      <hr>

      <h2 id="clinical_requirements">Clinical Requirements:<br>Information Needs and Data Dictionary.</h2>
      <p>
        Each Use Case dictates the clinical information that must be collected and shared, and thus the data that will later go into new or updated FHIR IGs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is for a group of clinical experts to work together to prioritize information requirements within a Data Dictionary needed for the Use Case. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This sub-step and subsequent steps are typically iterative.  For example, the clinical expert group may develop a first draft of the Data Dictionary. Subsequent steps often result in requests to the clinical experts for clarification or suggestions for updates to the Data Dictionary based on FHIR development, implementation, and testing.
      </p>

      <h3>Convening the Clinical Subject Matter Experts Group</h3>
      <p>
        Consider gathering 5 – 20 well-respected, collaborative, subject matter experts (SMEs) representing the breadth of expertise needed to establish and execute the Use Case.  The group needs clear leadership (e.g., a Chair or co-Chairs) by experts who are respected, well-organized, and well-versed in the overall Use Case and plan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider engaging (depending on the Use Case) patients, doctors, nurses, technicians, researchers, clinical experts from vendors, and/or payers.  Some of the SMEs should be familiar with previous work done to define clinical data elements and data dictionaries and are able to help the group understand the applicability of prior efforts to the work at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clinical SMEs do not need to be experts in FHIR development or HL7 processes. The group should use familiar medical terms and define clinical needs. It’s been found beneficial to include an objective facilitator, with experience moderating discussion and aligning diverse views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various tools and techniques for aligning expert views regarding priorities for information needs have been used in mCODE and CodeX Use Cases. A modified Delphi method was employed to expand mCODE to better-cover pediatric cancers. This method builds group consensus on information requirements based on expert judgement, literature review, and input from outside stakeholders to prioritize. Where consensus is not reached at first, the group can discuss discrepancies and make progress. Common tools for building consensus include Freemind, XMind, Coggle, whiteboarding, surveys, and spreadsheets. See below for how these methods work to build a Data Dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be helpful for the facilitator, and/or additional participants, to have familiarity with FHIR and the integration of FHIR IGs into systems and processes to lend those perspectives when needed. It would be helpful for someone to be familiar with work on related Use Cases to minimize the potential for duplication of effort or divergent approaches to the same data concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group should agree on a charter for their work, including scope, timelines, decision processes, etc. A sample charter can be found <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/PACIO+Project?preview=/90899598/97468371/2020-12-02%20PACIO%20Project%20Charter.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Minimal vs. Comprehensive</h3>
      <p>
        It’s been helpful to agree on how minimal vs. comprehensive the Data Dictionary should be. General principles in this regard could even be included in the charter, to ensure all participants are on the same page. CodeX work has focused on defining a minimal set of data elements for mCODE and each Use Case – covering the most common important cases, and not necessarily all edge cases. Keeping it minimal helps speed the development work and improve odd of achieving deliverables. The comprehensiveness of the Dictionary could be expanded or supplemented in the future.  
      </p>

      <h3>Defining the Data Dictionary</h3>
      <p>A Data Dictionary is a conversion of the clinical information gathered, to logical model data elements.</p>

      <p>
        The following table shows work-in-progress from a clinical expert group working to build a Data Dictionary for a Use Case to provide an initial assessment of a potential cancer patient. Methods and strategies like those noted above help the group get to this point. The table contains information needs (potential data elements), where the information could be extracted, references to prior work, and results of a survey of the experts regarding the “Relevance to Patients Like Mine” to help prioritize the minimal set of information needed.   
      </p>

      <p class="alert alert-warning">Image is placeholder only - will replace with accessible table</p>
            <p><img src="../images/clinical-info-survey.png" width="80%" class="py-5" alt="" /></p>

      <p>
        Once information needs have been prioritized (even if preliminary), the group should consider which information (data elements) should be Required, Optional, or Must Support.  E.g.: </p>
        <dl class="mx-4">
          <dt>Required</dt>
          <dd>Data is unusable or makes no sense if not present</dd>
          <dt>Optional</dt>
          <dd>Not always relevant and not needed for data to be usable</dd>
          <dt>Must Support</dt>
          <dd>Software is required to support this data element</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>

      <p>
        The group can next develop the Data Dictionary - a "Rosetta Stone" that defines data elements mapped to the clinical information requirements <!--[NOTE: This figure needs more context and/or probably moved?]-->
      </p>
      <p><img src="../images/rosetta-stone-table.png" width="100%" class="py-5" alt="" /></p>

      <h3>Common Challenges Related to Compiling Clinical Information Requirements and a Data Dictionary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Starting with a large set of “important” data needs/elements, rather than focusing on the needs for each prioritized Use Cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not thinking about how to maximize the utility of information across other potential Use Cases.  For example, the group may be working on information needed for initial diagnosis of cancer, but could also think ahead about other potential uses of that same information and how slight changes to their initial requirements might make that same information usable for, say, clinical trials matching, conducting trials, etc
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking for interpreted information rather than source data because that is established practice.  A trivial example would be asking for age, rather than collecting birth data and date/time of the encounter. 
        </li>
        <!--<li>[NOTE: more to be added]</li>-->

        <p>
          These and other potential pitfalls can be largely avoided by following the <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a> compiled based on CodeX and mCODE experience, and available from a link on the left.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Clinical Review of the Data Dictionary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the Data Dictionary address the goal and needs of the Use Cases?</li>
        <li>
          From a clinical perspective, will the new Data Dictionary be compatible with other, known or prospective data dictionaries with the specialty and outside of it?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="fhir_ig_development">FHIR IG Development:<br>Integrating Clinical Requirements into a Specialty FHIR Implementation Guide</h2>

      <p>
        Once the clinical subject matter expert group has at least a draft of their Data Dictionary for the Use Case, work can begin on incorporating the clinical information into one or more FHIR Implementation Guides (IG).  
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted before, the clinical expert group can't simply throw their Dictionary over the transom to the FHIR developers.  The two groups will have frequent collaboration, working to ensure the clinical information needs are captured properly in the FHIR IG, that the FHIR IG is implementable in systems and processes, and that it is consistent with the <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideal FHIR IG development group includes data modelers, FHIR Implementation Guide developers, terminologists, system developers, and one or more clinical specialty SMEs to ensure the translation of the clinical Data Dictionary into FHIR properly integrates all important information. The group needs clear leadership of the group (e.g., a Chair or co-Chairs), who are respected, well-organized, and well-versed in the overall Use Case plan.
      </p>

          <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a> is the health data sharing framework widely used now and is being mandated for certain applications through ONC.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR Implementation Guide</a> (IG) encapsulates into the FHIR framework the data classes and data elements defined through US Government coordination and the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and will evolve as Government work evolves. HL7 requires IGs designed for the US healthcare system to be based on the US Core FHIR framework unless a waiver is approved by HL7.
        </li>
        <li>
          Standard Terminology. (refs:  <a href="https://www.himss.org/terminology-standards">HIMSS</a>, <a href="https://mmshub.cms.gov/sites/default/files/Codes-Code-Systems-Value-Sets.pdf">CMS</a>) A terminology code system is a managed collection of structured terminologies (concepts like procedures, diagnoses, treatments, measurements, results, etc.) with the objective that there is one globally unique code (alpha-numeric, typically) to represent each concept. Code systems, terminologies, and vocabularies are not the same things, but are highly related and often used together or for the same idea. <a href="https://www.snomed.org/use-snomed-ct">SNOMED CT</a>, <a href="https://loinc.org/">LOINC</a>, <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/topics/cpt-codes">CPT</a> are some examples of widely used code systems. The benefit of representing a concept with standard terminology in an IG (and elsewhere) is that the concept can be implemented (in FHIR or other standards) in health information systems and understood everywhere the concept is collected, stored, exchanged, and used.
        </li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>
        The mCODE FHIR IG and other work in CodeX build on the above framework, plus the CodeX/mCODE <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a>.  This has many benefits, including helping to ensure (not guarantee) that products leveraging this framework are more likely to be consistent with other efforts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before going deeper into how a specialty FHIR IG can be built, consider the concept of a Standard Health Record (see figure below), a vision that would allow every person to have a lifetime health record in which their health data could be captured accurately and consistently across medical specialties.  Leveraging a common framework of US Core, standard terminologies, and the other Design Principles would enable individual specialties to develop their IGs relatively independently, and yet as consistently as possible. Some cross-specialty coordination would be helpful to maximize implementability and interoperability (filling gaps, avoiding duplication, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
        The SHR vision could extend the CodeX/mCODE approach to help new specialties expand communities, and to develop and test standards that are interoperable across specialties, and that drive adoption and value for patient health care and research.
      </p>
      <p class="alert alert-warning">Image is placeholder only - will replace with accessible image</p>
            <p><img src="../images/future-health-stack.png" width="100%" class="py-2" alt="" /></p>

      <h3>Data Model</h3>
      <p>
        The first task of the FHIR IG development group is to review the output of the Clinical group’s Data Dictionary.  It's helpful if some members of each group have been working together, even before the first draft of the Dictionary has been completed. Questions between the groups will be common and essential to taking additional steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next step is to start development of a logical model from the Data Dictionary.  The static graphic below is mCODE's conceptual model as of October 2023. Visit the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/">latest version of the mCODE FHIR IG</a>, where you can click on individual boxes in the graphic to dive into the details of where mCODE stands today. Conceptual models are notional and loosely represent the actual FHIR model. However, there are benefits to such representations, including enabling clinical and other SMEs to more easily understand context and use of elements, and illustrating how data elements relate to each other.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/mCODE-stu3-model_Oct2023.png" width="100%" alt="" />
        <figcaption>Example conceptual modeling diagram for mCODE STU 3 (2023) </figcaption>
      </figure>
              
      <h3>Terminologies</h3>
      <p>
        As noted before, terminologies, standard clinical code systems, are important for unambiguously defining how data within the data element are represented.  When a term cannot be found within an existing code system, it’s possible to work with the owner of the code system to add new terms, provided the justification is convincing.
      </p>

      <h3>Profiles and Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        FHIR profiles customize the standard FHIR base Resource definitions by constraining which values and elements of a Resource are required and which are not for a particular context or Use Case. FHIR extensions add data elements and/or constraints the standard FHIR base Resource definitions to create more specific, customized resource definitions for a particular context or Use Case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following shows how mCODE derived profiles from the aforementioned framework of the US Core FHIR IG. The subsequent three figures illustrate how the mCODE conceptual model is represented in the FHIR IG for patient demographics, labs, and medications to match the clinical information needs as structured data. [NOTE: A better explanation and better/higher resolution graphics will be included]
      </p>

      <img src="../images/profile-derivations.png" width="100%" alt="" />

      <p>
        Standards developers should first check the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/extension-registry.html">FHIR Extension Registry</a> for existing extensions that might be reused to provide a solution.  If an appropriate existing extension cannot be found, a new extension may need to be created as part of the IG.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Before creating a new extension, the development team should discuss the proposed extension and its purpose with the HL7 Working Group responsible for the FHIR Resource being extended. All FHIR resources and profiles have an HL7 Working Group that is responsible for its development.  The HL7 Working Group is listed on the FHIR resource page itself, or in the case of a profile, in the footer of the profile page. Reviewing the proposed extension with the responsible working group provides an opportunity for them to understand the purpose for the extension and offer guidance in alignment with their development strategy for the resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        New extensions require updating test scripts to validate implementations of the extension and help promote adoption.
      </p>

      <h3>Leveraging FHIR Packages and other FHIR IGs</h3>
      <p>
        FHIR Packages are a collection of FHIR resources and profiles that provide functionality that can be reused in projects. To get a list of published FHIR Packages, visit the <a href="https://registry.fhir.org/">FHIR Package Registry</a> to search for packages that might help address project requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/registry/">FHIR Implementation Guide Registry</a> can be used to find and search for published FHIR IGs that might be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When packages and other IGs are leveraged by a project, they become <i>dependencies</i> of that project. When depending on other FHIR packages and IGs to leverage, it is important to consider what versions to use, since in many cases, multiple versions may exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many factors that should be considered when determining what version of a FHIR package or IG to use:
        <ul>
          <li>Have they been officially published and if not, when will they publish?  This will affect the development timeline.</li>
          <li>
            What level of adoption does that version have or will have in the near future?  Using the latest version may push adoption further out instead of using an older version in broader use.
          </li>
          <li>
            What regulations may apply?  Regulations can stipulate what versions can be used (e.g., US Core version requirements for product certifications).

      <h3>Validating Modeling Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        Next, create a comprehensive set of FHIR resources that capture the product of the previous steps, One approach to validating the work is to match it to representative Use Case personas.  The next figure illustrates how parts of a particular patient journey are mapped into data elements and FHIR. See other <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/examples.html">mCODE examples, represented in the mCODE FHIR IG</a>.

      <h3>Creating the FHIR Implementation Guide</h3>

      <p>Initial creation of a FHIR IG can start quite early and iterate as the model is improved. </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/">FHIR Shorthand (FSH)</a> is a domain-specific language for defining FHIR artifacts involved in creation of FHIR Implementation Guides (IG). The goal of FSH is to allow Implementation Guide (IG) creators to more directly express their intent with fewer concerns about underlying FHIR mechanics, and efficiently produce high-quality FHIR IGs.”  FSH is an HL7 standard. FSH is increasingly used around the world.

      <h2 id="hl7_standardization">HL7 Standardization</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.hl7.org/">Health Level Seven (HL7)</a> is the preeminent organization for gathering communities to develop standards that enable health data interoperability. The US and other nations increasingly look to HL7 as the place for health standards development. >/p>
      <p>

      <h3>HL7 Standards Process</h3>
      <p>
        Agreeing on content of the FHIR IG to be standardized and then moving the IG through the HL7 process can take many months – on the order of a year from start to publication of a standard.  Time required depends on level of alignment of the IG authors, and also on how familiar project's standards process leader is with HL7 processes and people.  Project should make sure to include sufficient time in the Use Case plan, and also start the standardization process early (well before a complete draft FHIR IG is available).
      </p>
      <p>Resources that are important to review and understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HE/HL7+Essentials">HL7 Essentials</a>. Index to information on HL7, HL7 processes and other information that is relevant to anyone planning to work or working in HL7.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Understanding+the+Standards+Process">Understanding the Standards Process</a>.  Explains  what HL7 does, rationale for the processes, and how to maximize the benefits of using the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow">FHIR Implementation Guide Process Flow</a>. When creating a FHIR IG that is intended to an HL7 standard, there are a number of specific steps to complete.  A timeline based on HL7's early 2024 processes is shown here.  This is subject to change. Please check the previous link for the latest.

          HL7's graphic - <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=111117149">HL7 Process Flow and Timeline</a> - is also helpful in that steps in the HL7 process are linked to details on each step.
        </li>
      </ul>
        
      <h3>Maintaining HL7 Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Once the first version of a specialty standard (Standard for Trial Use or STU) has been completed and published, work begins on maintaining the standard over time. Any standard that is valued, implemented into systems, used widely will generate requests for updated versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Updates to specialty standards maybe needed for a variety of reasons. The standards on which your standard depends (e.g., FHIR, US Core) may be updated, and may require or at least motivate changes to standards that depend on them. Users may ask vendors who've integrated your standard or the vendors themselves may ask for updates. Government rules and regulations may motivate changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because changes to your standard may be required over time, it's important to keep a core of the original standards team intact (and add to that core), with the necessary skills (e.g., clinical, FHIR, HL7) available when needed. It's important to keep a good relationship with the sponsoring HL7 Work Group. It's necessary to have a system to collect, organize, prioritize, and address requests for changes and other comments - likely the same system used for building the original standard (e.g., Jira at HL7).
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware that the interest of the original team, and even that of the Use Case Champions, may change as the work enters maintenance. As repeatedly emphasized in this Playbook, think about which members of the Community care most about ensuring a standard is maintained in a well-governed, careful manner. For example, vendors who've implemented the standard and included the standard in products to many customers should care about how the standard is maintained and evolved.

      <h3>Best Practices for Smoother HL7 Standardization, Based on the CodeX/mCODE Experience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The standards process leader for the Use Case should have thorough knowledge of HL7 processes and standardization schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build HL7 standardization into your Use Case plan from the start.  Allow plenty of time to go through the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a good relationship with a sponsoring HL7 Work Group and its leadership. Ensure they are included in plans and progress, and respect that your IG is usually not the only IG the Work Group is responsible for. They likely won't have deep expertise in your health specialty (though, it's possible they do).  However, they will know HL7 standards (including FHIR), HL7 processes, and work that other Work Groups are doing that may be related to your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conducting the Use Case project within (or near) an HL7 FHIR Accelerator (CodeX or other) has the benefit of working within an organization that will be more knowledgeable of and more closely connected to HL7 people and processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discuss any new extension and its purpose with the HL7 Working Group that has responsibility for the FHIR Resource being extended, so that they understand the need and can provide guidance.
        </li>
