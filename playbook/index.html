      <h1>Introduction & Playbook Tracks</h1>
      <p class="lead">The MITRE Health Data Interoperability Playbook aims to help health specialty organizations create data standards that provide substantial improvements to patient care and research - within individual specialties and across all specialties.</p>


      <h2 id="motivation">Why?</h2>
      <p>Why is the Playbook being created and shared now? There are three primary reasons:</p>
<p>First, data interoperability remains a serious impediment to better and more affordable health care. Four of many studies, as of 2024, that demonstrate interoperability-driven impediments: 
<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.6561">Delays in treatments of an average of a month</a> can result from data sharing breakdowns associated with obtaining prior authorizations. 
It takes an average of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2803716">17 years for research to reach clinical practice</a>. 
It can take <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/national-program-cancer-registries/data-modernization/index.html">3 years for public health data to be aggregated</a> and available for broader use.  
Nearly <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2785480">$1 trillion is spent per year on healthcare administrative costs</a>, much of which could be reduced with more efficient, standardized data exchange.  

      <p>A second reason for sharing the Playbook now is that formerly disparate elements are converging to make this a prime time for other specialties to create FHIR-based standards to address challenges.
      Patients, providers, payer, researchers and others are realizing the need for standards that provide semantic interoperability. Recent Government rules and regulations are driving a standards-based underpinning (see <a href="standards.html">Standards Development</a>) upon which future specialty and other application standards can build. Vendors are working to meet customer demands and Government direction, delivering products increasingly based on standards. CodeX and mCODE have leveraged these underpinnings from the start. </p>
      
<p> The third reason for MITRE to share this Playbook is that MITRE has had a primary role in creating and building a Community within the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home">CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator</a>, building applications using the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE">mCODE cancer data standard</a>, and the accelerating adoption of <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Use+Cases">CodeX's mCODE-based Use Cases</a> to address interoperability challenges in the oncology space. This success has led leaders in the cardiovascular and genomics domains to start work in CodeX. It has also led many additional medical specialties to ask MITRE's experts questions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are CodeX and mCODE?</li>
        <li>What impact are CodeX and mCODE making to enable data interoperability and solve real health challenges?</li>
        <li>What was your approach, and its rationale?</li>
        <li>How could my specialty replicate the impacts realized by CodeX and mCODE, and perhaps move even faster?</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>These questions are just some of the motivations that led MITRE to consolidate and share its experience in CodeX, mCODE, and other FHIR-based standards initiatives via this Playbook.</p>
<p>There are approaches in addition to MITRE's that may be useful to review. Whatever approach is followed, the outcome must be consistent with other specialties and in the best interest of all patients who typically need the services of multiple specialties during their lifetime. MITRE's <a href="./#organization">Playbook Tracks</a> and <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a> aim to ensure the necessary level of consistency and quality and have a track record of success that can be reviewed here and elsewhere.</p> 
      
      <h2 id="intended_audience">Who?</h2>
      <p>Who is the intended audience for the Playbook? The Playbook should be valuable to a range of organizations and people interested in creating and leveraging specialty health data standards to address real-world challenges.</p>
      <p>The site should be particularly helpful for specialty leaders exploring how to replicate the model pioneered for oncology in CodeX to apply in their own specialty.  This site may encourage specialty leaders to work more closely with CodeX and other specialties to speed work and increase coherency.</p>
<p>Parts of the site will be useful to particular stakeholders (e.g., patient organizations, health systems, specialty societies, government agencies, payers, vendors, etc.) and particular roles (e.g., decision makers, funders, project managers, Community organizers, clinical experts, informaticists, standards developers, system engineers, communications personnel, etc.) involved in just a subset of the spectrum of all future work. See a recommended set of <a href="../resources/roles.html">Key Playbook Sections by Role</a> to help guide people with leadership, clinical, or technical responsibilities to find the most relevant information for them.</p>
<p>
To get the most out of the Playbook, it would be helpful for leaders to have or acquire a high-level knowledge of standards that are foundational in the Playbook (e.g., the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a>, <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>, <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR Implementation Guide</a>, etc.).  Standards implementers should, of course, have a much deeper understanding of these foundations. </p>
  
      <h2 id="organization">How?</h2>
      <p>"How" is this Playbook is organized? The Playbook is organized around "How" the CodeX Community approaches its work:  This approach has five tracks that overlap in time, interact substantially, and have been improving with experience. The first graphic below is a simplified representation of the five tracks.  The second graphic shows a notional timeline of the overlapping and interacting tracks for a given Use Case.  In CodeX, the time from the start of the work to initial adoption of a Use Case solution might be 3 - 5 years.</p>

      <p>A brief description of each track with a link to the more detailed page for each:  
      <ol class="section-list">
        <li><a href="community.html">Community Building</a>: Community starts with leadership from committed "Champions" who have broad reach, a grasp of key challenges and potential Use Cases, and the ability to grow the Community with skilled and active participants. A fair and sustainable Governance framework must be established. Certain organizations and skills may be needed only at certain points with one or more tracks. </li>
        <li><a href="use_cases_planning.html">Use Cases & Planning</a>: The Community must prioritize well-defined projects that address key challenges, offer new work and data flows, and scope the clinical information requirements. They must organize and schedule Use Case work all the way through to adoption and measuring value, and secure the resources (organizations, Champions, people/skills) needed to succeed. Specific Use Cases attract additional subsets of each specialty.</li>
        <li><a href="standards.html">Standards Development</a>: Standards Development starts with compiling clinical experts’ minimal set of core information requirements for each Use Case. Clinical requirements are incorporated into HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guides (IGs) based on a set of <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a>, and standardized, updated, and maintained the within the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards organization.</li>
        <li><a href="implementation.html">Implementation & Testing</a>: Standard FHIR IG(s) must be integrated into systems and workflows. These standardized systems and workflows are ultimately piloted within the types of organizations ultimately planned to host, use, and benefit from the work. Feedback from testing is used to update Planning and Standards work. Testing serves to demonstrate the potential value of the work and often attracts additional participants to the Community.</li>
        <li><a href="adoption.html">Adoption & Value</a>: To have value, standardized systems must be used widely in the real world. Getting to this point starts by understanding, during Planning, which factors will move the market. Factors include user demand, Government mandates, and the promise of improved care and research demonstrated during testing. It’s critical to Measure such improvements in the real world, to see where updates could make solutions even better (quality, cost, time) and to motivate new users to adopt. Though not shown in the graphic, real world use will lead to additional feedback to any or all of the other tracks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The five tracks are explored in greater depth by following the links in the above list, and via the Playbook Menu found on all pages.</p>

      <p>Questions that a new specialty should ask themselves <b>before</b> embarking on the above tracks are covered on the <a href="getting_started.html">Before Starting</a> page. The <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a> have been compiled to ensure alignment between different standards development initiatives, whether within or across specialties.</p>

      <p>Also provided in the Playbook are <a href="../casestudies/">Case Studies</a> that leverage the tracks, including the history of activities, outcomes, and lessons that may be useful for new specialties. Playbook sections recommended for people in particular roles, lower-level details on particular topics, and links related to the tracks and Case Studies can be found on the <a href="../resources/">Resources</a> page.</p>
