      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="lead">The MITRE Health Data Interoperability Playbook aims to help health specialty organizations create data standards that provide substantial improvements to patient care and research - within individual specialties and across all specialties.</p>


      <h2 id="motivation">Why?</h2>
      <p>Why is the Playbook being created and shared now? MITRE has had a primary role in creating and building a Community within the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home">CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator</a>, building applications using the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE">mCODE cancer data standard</a>, and the accelerating adoption of <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Use+Cases">CodeX's mCODE-based Use Cases</a> to address challenges in the oncology space. This success has led leaders in the cardiovascular and genomics domains to start work in CodeX. It has also led many additional medical specialties to ask MITRE's experts questions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are CodeX and mCODE?</li>
        <li>What impact are CodeX and mCODE making to enable data interoperability and solve real health challenges?</li>
        <li>What was your approach, and its rationale?</li>
        <li>How could my specialty replicate the impacts realized by CodeX and mCODE, and perhaps move even faster?</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>These questions are just some of the motivations that led MITRE to share its experience in CodeX, mCODE, and other FHIR-based standards initiatives in this Playbook.</p>
      <p>In addition, formerly disparate elements are converging to make this a prime time for other specialties to create FHIR-based standards to address challenges.
      Patients, providers, payer, researchers and others are realizing the need for standards that provide semantic interoperability. Recent Government rules and regulations are driving a standards-based underpinning (see <a href="standards.html">Standards Development</a>) upon which future specialty and other application standards can build. Vendors are working to meet customer demands and Government direction, delivering products increasingly based on standards. CodeX and mCODE have leveraged these underpinnings from the start. </p>
      <p>There are approaches in addition to MITRE's that may be useful to review. Whatever approach is followed, the outcome must be consistent with other specialties and in the best interest of all patients who typically need the services of multiple specialties during their lifetime. MITRE's <a href="./#organization">Approach</a> and <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a> aim to ensure the necessary level of consistency and quality and have a track record of success that can be reviewed here and elsewhere.</p> 
      
      <h2 id="intended_audience">Who?</h2>
      <p>Who is the intended audience for the Playbook? The Playbook should be valuable to a range of organizations and people interested in creating and leveraging specialty health data standards to address real-world challenges.</p>
      <p>The site should be particularly helpful for specialty leaders exploring how to replicate the model pioneered for oncology in CodeX to apply in their own specialty.  This site may encourage specialty leaders to work more closely with CodeX and other specialties to speed work and increase coherency.</p>
<p>Parts of the site will be useful to particular stakeholders (e.g., patient organizations, health systems, specialty societies, government agencies, payers, vendors, etc.) and particular roles (e.g., decision makers, funders, project managers, Community organizers, clinical experts, informaticists, standards developers, system engineers, communications personnel, etc.) involved in just a subset of the spectrum of all future work. See a recommended set of <a href="../resources/roles.html">Key Playboook Sections by Role</a> to help guide people with leadership, clinical, or technical responsibilities to find the most relevant information for them.</p>
<p>
To get the most out of the Playbook, it would be helpful for leaders to have or acquire a high-level knowledge of standards that are foundational in the Playbook (e.g.,the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a>, <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>, <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR Implementation Guide</a>, etc.).  Standards implementers should, of course, have a much deeper understanding of these foundations. </p>
  
      <h2 id="organization">How?</h2>
      <p>"How" is this Playbook is organized? The Playbook is organized around "How" the CodeX Community approaches its work:  This approach has five tracks that overlap in time, interact substantially, and have been improving with experience. The first graphic below is a simplified representation of the five tracks.  The second graphic shows a notional timeline of the overlapping and interacting tracks for a given Use Case.  In CodeX, the time from the start of the work to initial adoption of a Use Case solution might be 3 - 5 years.</p>

      <p>A brief descripion of each track with a link to the more detailed page for each:  
      <ol class="section-list">
        <li><a href="community.html">Community Building</a>, including the leadership committed "Champions" who have broad reach; a fair and sustainable Governance framework; and a growing group of diverse participants and skillsets. Certain organizations and skills may be needed only at certain points with one or more tracks. </li>
        <li><a href="use_cases_planning.html">Use Cases & Planning</a>, including prioritizing Use Cases (specific challenges, proposed new work and data flows); organizing and scheduling work all the way through to adoption and measuring value; and securing the resources (organizations, people/skills) needed to succeed. Specific Use Cases attract specific subsets of each specialty.</li>
        <li><a href="standards.html">Standards Development</a>, based on compiling clinical experts’ information requirements for executing Use Cases; incorporating these requirements into HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guides (IGs) based on a set of <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a>; and standardizing, updating, and maintaining the FHIR IGs within the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards organization.</li>
        <li><a href="implementation.html">Implementation & Testing</a>, including building FHIR IG(s) into systems and workflows; testing these systems and workflows through test suites and within the types of organizations ultimately planned to host, use, and benefit from the work; and compiling feedback from testing to update Planning and Standards work. Testing serves to demonstrate the potential value of the work and often attracts additional participants to the Community.</li>
        <li><a href="adoption.html">Adoption & Value</a> in the real world, starting by developing an understanding at the Planning track of what factors will move the market. Factors include user demand, Government mandates, and the promise of improved care and research demonstrated during testing. It’s critical to Measure such improvements in the real world, to see where changes could make solutions even better (quality, cost, time) and motivate new participants to engage. Though not shown in the graphic, real world use will lead to additional feedback to any or all of the other tracks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The five tracks are explored in greater depth by following the links in the above list, and via the Playbook Menu found on all pages.</p>

      <p>Questions that a new specialty should ask themselves <b>before</b> embarking on the above tracks are covered on the <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> page. The <a href="design_principles.html">Design Principles</a> have been compiled to ensure alignment between different standards development initiatives, whether within or across specialties.</p>

      <p>Also provided in the Playbook are <a href="../casestudies/">Case Studies</a> that leverage the tracks, including the history of activities, outcomes, and lessons that may be useful for new specialties. Playbook sections recommended for people in particular roles, lower-level details on particular topics, and links related to the tracks and Case Studies can be found on the <a href="../resources/">Resources</a> page.</p>
