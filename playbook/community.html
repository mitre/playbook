      <h1>Track 1. Community Building</h1>
      <p class="lead">Gathering the right organizations and people is the most challenging, foundational, and necessary experience for success.</p>
      <p>Most people reviewing this site understand that enabling true health data interoperability is as much a social challenge as it is a medical or technical challenge. It takes people who share a vision and mission, who can align diverse views of how to get there, and who will invest the resources needed to change the status quo and gain sustainable growth and momentum. </p>

      <p>Actions that <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home">CodeX</a> has found indispensable include (a) engaging champions, (b) establishing governance, (c) growing the community, and (d) communicating value propositions that enable growth.  These actions are expanded upon below.</p>
<div id="champions">
      <h2>Champions</h2>
      <p>An essential first step when starting a new specialty initiative or starting a new use case within that initiative is to identify champions. In CodeX, successful champions are organizations and individuals that:</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li><b>Commit to leading</b> the initiative and/or use case</li>
        <li><b>Know</b> the challenges and opportunities (leading to potential use cases), organizations, people, and related initiatives within the larger specialty community</li>
        <li><b>Command the attention</b> of a larger community and can <b>influence</b> future users and stakeholders to engage</li>
        <li><b>Motivate implementation</b> of new standards into vendor solutions</li>
        <li><b>Motivate the changes in health processes</b> needed to use and benefit from of the standards-based systems </li>
        <li><b>Attract the resources</b> needed to succeed</li>
        <li><b>Drive</b> one or more key tracks of the initiative and/or use case: Community Building, Use Case & Planning, Standards Development, Implementation & Testing, Adoption & Value</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Champions and all who actively participate will most likely understand the challenges for which standards-based data interoperability provide substantial benefits. These participants will develop a shared vision for a future where patient data can be collected once, and then used with no or little manipulation for many use cases around patient care, research, and other applications.</p>
      <p>It's clear that champions have significant responsibilities.  But they also realize future benefits in terms of prioritizing use cases, defining direction, achieving objectives, and ultimately improving health care and research within their organizations and across the landscape. </p>
      <p>Large, medical professional societies and government organizations have been the most frequent CodeX use case champions, but other stakeholders have also been effective champions. The founding champions for the overall CodeX initiative (which started by addressing challenges in oncology) were <a href="https://www.asco.org">American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</a>, with reach to all oncologists and centers; and <a href="https://www.mitre.org">The MITRE Corporation</a>, with deep expertise in convening, FHIR standards and systems engineering. </p>
</div>
<div id="governance">
      <hr>
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>A governance framework is important for any initiative involving many organizations, often with divergent interests and views. An agreed (generally, by member organizations) and documented governance framework ensures that the community hears and understands participants' views and interests. Governance delineates how and by whom decisions are taken. Example decisions include updates to the governance structure itself, Membership structure and fees, adjudicating conflicts, administrative support, starting new use case work, and providing funding and resources to projects in special cases when the community can’t provide funding and resources. </p>
      <p>The CodeX Accelerator provides the governance for use cases around cancer (and the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE">mCODE standard</a>), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to start and to coordinate effectively across specialties.  </p>
      <p>The graphic below captures the CodeX governance structure as of 2024.  The tiered structure offers participation at different levels of responsibility and time commitment.  Details of the current <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Governance">CodeX governance scheme</a> can be found on their website.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../images/governance_structure.png" width="100%" class="py-3" alt="Block diagram of CodeX governance structure" />
        <figcaption>Block diagram showing structure of CodeX governance, including Steering Committee, Operating Committee, Use Case Projects, and Community of Practice</figcaption>
      </figure>
  
      <p>A few points regarding CodeX Ggvernance: The elected steering committee makes major decisions including, governance structure, use cases, funding decisions, and moving projects into execution stage. The vast majority of all the community's volunteer resources are invested in the use case projects.  The community of Practice (near the bottom of the graphic) is open to the public and has been an effective feeder of new organizations and talents into CodeX membership and use cases.</p>
      <p>One key factor in CodeX's oncology work is the mCODE Executive Committee and its Technical Review Group (“External Expert Groups” circle on right). These groups provide clinical subject matter expertise across oncology fields and ensure the mCODE FHIR Implementation Guide is based on the most credible and recent clinical knowledge.</p>
      <p>A strategy for sustaining work is important. Communities cannot achieve success overnight. In CodeX, participants provide the range of skills and support necessary to drive each use case forward. Funding for overarching program management (near top of the graphic above) comes largely from membership fees (plus some volunteer effort). Based on 2024 CodeX Membership (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership">view current membership list</a>) and Membership fee structure (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership+Options">view current fee structure</a>) Membership fees provide about $800K (2024 USD) annually primarily for Program Management.</p>

</div>
<div id="growth">
      <hr>
      <h2>Community Growth</h2>
      <p>To advance use cases, the community needs a variety of organizations and skillsets  to establish  an overarching vision of adoption and real-world value. Thus, the community must be grown such that there are participants with direct experience related to each of the envisioned roles in the specialty initiative and its use cases.</p>
      <p>For example, in the CodeX Radiation Therapy Case Study, the team included participants from radiation therapy societies, health systems, payers, and vendors. Skillsets included clinical practice, radiation oncologists, radiation physicists, software engineers, informaticists, FHIR experts, HL7 standards process experts, and more. Getting the right set of people together at the right times in the process can be challenging. It is ideal to have redundancy among these roles, to bring in a diversity of experience and to provide forward momentum as participants cycle on and off the project. Champion leadership and collaboration as a committed and focused team is critical.</p>
      <p>The good news is that a promising use case has the potential to attract new participants. These participants appreciate the potential value of the work, are willing to invest resources to realize that value, and want to be at the table where decisions are made, and work is executed.</p>

</div>
<div id="value_prop">
    <hr>
    <h2>Value Propositions</h2>
      <p>To grow a community of diverse stakeholder groups required for a health standards initiative to succeed, it's important to understand and communicate the value propositions for each group. Further, it's helpful to think about value in two directions: <b>(a) How can the standards initiative provide value to each stakeholder group?</b>, and (b) <b>How can each stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?</b></p>
<p>Below are value statements, looking in both directions, for six stakeholder groupings:</p>

      <div class="community-growth-items">
      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Providers, Health Systems & Associated Specialty Societies</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to Providers, Health Systems, and Associated Specialty Societies?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
         <li>The initiative's Use Cases and standards could enable better care at lower cost (more accurate and complete data that can be collected and shared more readily, thus improving diagnoses, treatment, consultations, automation, level of effort, and expenses).</li>
         <li>Shared decision-making between patients and providers could be realized.</li>
         <li>Valuable secondary uses of the standards-based data could be realized (e.g., quality measure reporting, payer communications, prior authorization procedures, research, etc.). </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can Providers, Health Systems, and Associated Specialty Societies provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>By representing, informing, and convincing a broad group of clinical and administrative constituents that this initiative should be supported.</li>
        <li>By committing experts who can provide deep clinical knowledge.</li>
        <li>By demanding standards-based solutions from their vendors.</li>
        <li>By finding and providing funding.</li>

         <li>The initiative's Use Cases and standards could enable better patient care at lower cost (more accurate and complete data that can be collected and shared more readily, thus improving diagnoses, treatment, consultations, automation, level of effort, and expenses).</li>
        <li>A common motto of CodeX work is that “every patient’s journey improves all future care”, as well as the care of the patient at hand. </li>
        <li>Shared decision-making between patients and providers could be realized.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can Patients and Associated Advocate Societies provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>By representing, informing, and convincing a broad group of patients and caregivers.</li>
        <li>By providing the patient's perspective to ensure a patient-centered approach is at the center of Use Cases and standards work.</li>
        <li>Patients will increasingly demand the ability to aggregate, share, and control their health data (and thus motivate standards adoption).</li>
      </ul>
      

      <!-- =========================================== -->

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to Vendors? </p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Vendors can help align customer interests, and thus reduce their level of effort on custom implementations.</li>
        <li>They can provide input to ensure standards are implementable in their systems and are consistent across specialties (cost effective development and maintenance).</li>
        <li>Vendors who participate actively have a first-mover advantage that can drive their products to market ahead of competitors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can Vendors provide value to the standards initiative?  </p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>By responding when their customers ask for products based on standards.</li>
        <li>By committing experts who can provide deep technical implementation knowledge.</li>
        <li>By looking across customers and across specialties and suggesting ways to develop standards to optimize implementation, use, and maintenance within systems.</li>
