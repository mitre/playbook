        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>History 2017-2018</h3>
        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> The lucky spark was a chance encounter between former medical colleagues, Dr. Jay Schnitzer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, on an airplane in 2017. Bertagnolli was a preeminent cancer surgeon at Brigham and Women’s and was leading the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Alliance for Cancer Trials in Oncology (ACTO). Dr. Schnitzer, was Chief Technology Officer at MITRE, with a growing portfolio of health information technology research.</p>
        <p>Drs. Bertagnolli and Schnitzer had been circling around how to achieve a Learning Health System, where caring for every patient results in learning from every patient. Every person with any disease should have access to high-quality care, and also will have the opportunity for their experience to help others in the future. </p>
<p>Drs. Bertagnolli and Schntzer had also been circling around one of the fundamental challenges to achieving a Learning Health System: Lack of a single standard for collecting and sharing patient data electronically.  They partnered to launch a new data standard, starting with cancer data : the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements FHIR Implementation Guide (mCODE IG). It was not long before other influential and skilled people and orgnizations joined in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>ASCO and MITRE, led by Drs. Bertagnolli and Schnitzer, became what we now call <a href="../playbook/community.html#champions">Champions</a> for the new oncology specialty initiative. As <strong>Champions</strong>, they:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Committed their leadership</li>
          <li>Offered many of the key <strong>capabilities</strong> needed to start and succeed:

              <li>ASCO and ACTO – clinical </li>
              <li>MITRE – <strong>standards</strong> and systems engineering </li>
              <li>Both – convening power</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Had access to potential members of the <strong>community</strong> and the resources needed develop and leverage mCODE: 
            <ul>
              <li>ASCO and ACTO –  access to almost all clinical cancer organizations and vendors</li>
              <li>MITRE –  deep expertise in standards and systems engineering</li>
              <li>Both –  strong links to Federal health agencies.</li>

        <h3>History 2018-2019</h3>
        <p>First Use Case:  <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/EHR+Endpoints+for+Cancer+Clinical+Trials" class="fw-bold">EHR Endpoints for Cancer Clinical Trials (ICAREdata study)</a>. This project aimed to capture and share, using the mCODE standard, high quality clinical treatment data within electronic health records (EHRs) that could be used for oncology research.</p>
        <p>ACTO and MITRE became the ICAREdata Use Case Champions. Over time, multiple health systems, clinical trials, Epic, NCI and FDA participated in, hosted, and/or funded development and testing.</p>  
        <p>Focus was on standardizing and collecting just three key data elements (- cancer type, disease status (e.g., progressing, stable...), and reason for treatment change) - all modeled within the fledgling mCODE IG.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>ACTO, and MITRE understood that the best way to develop a cancer data standard is to focus on the small set of core data elements needed for specific Use Cases (e.g., specific challenges) that, if empowered by standardized data, could have a substantial impact.</p>
        <p>ACTO and ASCO’s credibility and clinical network facilitated engagement of outstanding clinical experts and vendors.</p>
        <p>Adoption and Value in real-world settings was in the Plan from the start. This ultimately helped refine mCODE and workflows and led to greater participation and substantial funding.</p>
        <p>This Use Case also helped identify the skillsets necessary during different phases of Use Case work.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p><b>mCODE Design:</b>  The ICAREdata Use Case provided helped establish an approach and structure for mCODE (around patient, assessments, disease, treatment, outcomes, genomics), and design principles.</p>
      <p><b>mCODE V 1.0 IG</b> was balloted in the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards organization in 2019, and benefited substantially from the ICAREdata experience.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>mCODE design principles that became clear during the ICAREdata Use Case included the following and have served mCODE’s evolution since. Principles include:  Focus on discrete data collect during patient encounters. Collect clinical input first and engage clinical experts as specific review points for the IG. Base the IG on government and industry requirements and trends (e.g., FHIR, US Core). Leverage the best existing clinical data modeling efforts. Adopt global standard code systems.

        <p><a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/2019+Cancer+Data+Summit?preview=/66923557/66934772/Cancer-Data-Summit-Summary_2019.pdf" class="fw-bold">Cancer Data Summit</a>: Interest in mCODE was starting to build and new Use Cases were being proposed. A small group of leaders from across the oncology space (patients, providers, researchers, payers, gov’t agencies, vendors, etc.) convened for two days in October 2019 to brainstorm on the future of standardized cancer data, obstacles that could be prevent success, and next steps. Below is one of the many  storytelling roadmaps from the Summit. One outcome was support for creating a clinical requirements group (which became the mCODE Executive Committee) and an implementation group (which became the CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>The Summit provided substantial benefits. Extremely useful feedback was provided by a diverse set of leaders. Noticeable alignment between diverse views happened during the two day event. Strategies for next steps were shared. Many who attended the Summit expressed interested in staying involved, and many of those became Champions and participants in the future mCODE Executive Committee and CodeX Community.</p>

        <p><b>mCODE Executive Committee and Technical Review Group</b>: This body was organized under the leadership of ASCO, and included clinical leaders and experts from major cancer-related societies, government agencies, and others as needed.  The mandate continues to be to maintain and evolve the clinical description of the data elements in mCODE.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>It has proven beneficial to have this strictly clinical group focusing on clinical requirements and interpretation. An expert can be an invaluable contributor to mCODE, without being deeply involved in the technical and logistical work of that CodeX would take on. However, a valuable, small subset of those involved in Executive Committee have joined CodeX work.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><b>CodeX Community</b> To complement the Executive Committee’s clinical leadership, MITRE led the creation of CodeX within HL7’s then-new FHIR Accelerator Program. CodeX was established, and still operates, with a focus on creating FHIR IGs, but also just as importanly a focus on implementing FHIR IGs into software and workflows, testing these in the field, and supporting adoption and value measurement in the real world. A lightweight process, <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Governance">governance structure</a> and <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership+Options">Membership fee model</a> were established.

        <p>Establishing the goal of adoption and value of a standard, rather than focusing primarily on standards development, was and is not easy.  This generally takes a greater commitment of resources and time from more parts of the community to achieve the goal. However, this goal resonated with the growing community, and ultimately paid off in new Use Cases, Members, adoption and value in the real world.</p>
