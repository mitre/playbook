      <p class="lead"> In 2017, leaders within <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %> and the <%= link_to("American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)","https://www.asco.org/") %> recognized a fundamental challenge in oncology: lack of a single standard for collecting and sharing data electronically. This lack of standardization led to numerous issues, including difficulties in sharing data, data errors, delays in analyzing data and prescribing treatments, increased costs for care and research, and other problems that ultimately impact the patient.</p>

      <p class="lead">To address these issues, MITRE and ASCO partnered with a diverse group of leading experts to develop the <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>: a FHIR-based standard for oncology data capture and sharing. MITRE also worked with Health Level Seven (HL7) to launch the <%=link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator", "https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %>: a still-growing Community of providers, patient advocates, researchers, payers, vendors, regulators, and other stakeholders who are driving adoption of mCODE through standards-based solutions to a range of real-world challenges.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">This Health Data Interoperability Playbook ("the Playbook") summarizes MITRE's experience leading mCODE and CodeX, with the intent of helping <%= link_to("Champions", "/playbook/community.html#champions") %> and their teams from additional specialties guide their Communities through the development of data standards that improve health care and research.</p>
      
      <p>The Playbook is organized around five tracks that form a framework for the CodeX / mCODE approach: <%= link_to("Community Building", "/playbook/community.html") %>, <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "/playbook/use_cases_planning.html") %>, <%= link_to("Standards Development", "/playbook/standards.html") %>, <%= link_to("Implementation & Testing", "/playbook/implementation.html") %>, and <%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "/playbook/adoption.html") %>. A high-level overview of the five tracks can be found in the <%= link_to("Introduction", "/playbook/index.html#organization") %>, with more details on each track via the links above and the Playbook Menu site navigation.</p>
      
      <p>Questions that a new specialty should ask themselves before embarking on the above tracks are covered on the <%= link_to("Getting Started", "/playbook/getting_started.html") %> page. The <%= link_to("Design Principles", "/playbook/design_principles.html") %> have been compiled to produce quality standards efficiently, and also to ensure alignment between different standards development initiatives within and across specialties.</p>
            
      <p>Also provided are <%= link_to("Case Studies", "/casestudies/index.html") %> that illustrate how specific projects have leveraged the tracks. Case Studies include the history of activities, outcomes of the work, and lessons learned that may be useful for new specialties. Additional details related to the tracks and Case Studies can be found in the <%= link_to("Resources", "/resources/index.html") %> section.</p>
