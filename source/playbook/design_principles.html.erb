      <h1>Design Principles</h1>
      
      <p class="lead">
        Below are principles that have guided the <%= link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator Community","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> and in the design, development, testing, and adoption of FHIR-based data standards, including <%= link_to("mCODE","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>. If additional specialties follow these principles, the resulting standards are more likely to be developed efficiently, and to be interoperable and compatible across specialties as part of a life-time patient Standard Health Record.

      <ol class="principles-list col-lg-10">
        <li>Develop data standards that are <b>Open</b>, <b>Community-driven</b>, <b>Use Case-driven</b>, and with <b>adoption</b> and <b>value</b> the focus from the beginning.
          <ul>
            <li>Need broadest possible support of patients, providers, Gov’t, vendors, payers, etc.</li>
            <li>Ensure standards are informed by and address minmimally-scoped Use Cases that focus on real, specific Community problems. Plan from the start of a Use Case project for its implementation, adoption, and real value.</li>
            <li>Standardize the work through an open, royalty-free health standards development organization, like <a href="https://www.hl7.org/">Health Level Seven (HL7).</a></li>
            <li>Demonstrate potential value and motivate adoption in real-world environments.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Ensure that standardized <b>data</b> must be part of every patient's <b>standard of care</b>. 
          <ul>
            <li>The primary focus is collection and sharing of quality, core, standardized data related to <b>patient care and outcomes</b>, with a visionary result of a coherent lifetime Standard Health Record for every patient.</li>
            <li>Data originally collected for one patient's health state can be important for future states.</li>
            <li>Secondary uses of patient care data (personal, research, quality measurement, payer operations, etc.) will be hugely valuable and more cost-effective than current approaches.</li>
            <li>Can also create supplemental IGs when the data requirements are not considered core, but important for smaller Communities and/or edge applications.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Represent data in the standard as <b>discrete</b> observations and actions (e.g., patient birth date = 11/04/1989 vs. patient is 34 years old).
          <ul>
            <li>Allows aggregated calculations using different observations and actions, via different approaches, for different Use Cases, at different times.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Collect patient data once</b> (generally around the encounter). Data collected can then be reused for multiple Use Cases going forward.
          <ul>
            <li>Not all data elements will be collected for every patient during every encounter, since people and their disease states differ.</li>
            <li>When data should be collected, the standard provides the template.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Define a <b>minimal set of clinical data elements</b> that address core Use Case requirements and could potentially be used for multiple Use Cases.
          <ul>
            <li>Create supplemental IGs for more data needs beyond the minimal set that are necessary for specialized situations.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Ensure <b>consistent representation</b> of data elements that may be used across specialties.
          <ul>
            <li>Different specialties require similar data that might have been historically described differently.</li>
            <li>Establish principles, templates, and cross-specialty processes that reconcile differences and consolidate solutions in one place, where possible.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Leverage <b>Government-backed interoperability standards</b> whenever possible
          <ul>
            <li>e.g., <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a>, <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>, <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR Implementation Guide</a>, and others. </li>
            <li>Gov’t support increases motivation for adoption and thus provides a stronger basis for cross-specialty interoperability.</li>
            <li>May require changes to representations of previous work.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Leverage the <b>best, previous work</b> (standards, tools, etc.).
          <ul>
            <li>If previous work in the space exists, seek to work with the other initiatives and if possible, adopt/adapt their work rather than re-do it.</li>
            <li>Leverage the available approaches and tools for modeling and IG development.</li>
            <li>These will motivate higher-quality FHIR IGs that are more coherent across specialties, Use Cases, and projects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Leverage <b>global code systems and terminology standards</b>.
          <ul>
            <li>Observations and actions can be represented consistently within and across specialties, in many cases, around the world using standardized, widely used terminologies, vocabularies, and codes (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT, CPT, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Get input and review through <b>clinical specialists and patients first</b>, then other medical, standards, and vendor experts.
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure clinical relevance as a priority.</li>
            <li>Add other health Use Cases, technical, and standards expertise.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>These are data standards primarily for <b>data exchange</b>. 
          <ul>
            <li>Data exchange standards can also influence data collection to the extent that data that must be exchanged must be collected or computed from data that are collected.</li>
            <li>How the data are stored within systems can be defined by the implementor to meet engineering requirements.</li>
            <li>How the data are displayed and manipulated (e.g., interfaces for collection, aggregation, review, computation, analysis, etc.) can be defined by the implementor to meet user requirements.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Controlled by the patient</b>.
          <ul>
            <li>Patients decide who gets what data for what purposes for what timeframes in a way that follows the data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
