      <h1>Track 1. Community Building</h1>
      <p class="lead">Gathering the right organizations and people has been the most foundational and challenging track in the MITRE Interoperability Playbook.</p>
      <p>It’s very likely that almost everyone reviewing this site agrees that enabling true health data interoperability is as much a social challenge as it is a medical or technical challenge. It takes people who share a vision and mission, can align diverse views of how to get there, and invest the resources needed to change the status quo and gain sustainable growth and momentum. </p>

      <p>Actions that <%= link_to("CodeX","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> has found indispensable include (a) engaging champions, (b) establishing governance, (c) growing the community, and (d) communicating value propositions that enable growth.  These actions are expanded upon below.</p>
<div id="champions">
      <h2>Champions</h2>
      <p>An essential first step when starting a new specialty initiative or starting a new use case within that initiative is to identify champions. In CodeX, successful champions are organizations and individuals that:</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li><b>Commit to leading</b> the initiative and/or use case</li>
        <li><b>Know</b> the challenges and opportunities (leading to potential use cases), organizations, people, and related initiatives within the larger specialty community</li>
        <li><b>Command the attention</b> of a larger community and can <b>influence</b> future users and stakeholders to engage</li>
        <li><b>Motivate implementation</b> of new standards into vendor solutions</li>
        <li><b>Motivate the changes in health processes</b> needed to use and benefit from of the standards-based systems </li>
        <li><b>Attract the resources</b> needed to succeed</li>
        <li><b>Drive</b> one or more key tracks of the initiative and/or use case: Community Building, Use Case & Planning, Standards Development, Implementation & Testing, Adoption & Value</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Champions and all who actively participate will most likely understand the challenges for which standards-based data interoperability provide substantial benefits. These participants will develop a shared vision for a future where patient data can be collected once, and then used with no or little manipulation for many use cases around patient care, research, and other applications.</p>
      <p>It's clear that champions have significant responsibilities.  But they also realize future benefits in terms of prioritizing use cases, defining direction, achieving objectives, and ultimately improving health care and research within their organizations and across the landscape. </p>
      <p>Large, medical professional societies and government organizations have been the most frequent CodeX use case champions, but other stakeholders have also been effective champions. The founding champions for the overall CodeX initiative (which started by addressing challenges in oncology) were <%= link_to("American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)","https://www.asco.org") %>, with reach to all oncologists and centers; and <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %>, with deep expertise in convening, FHIR standards and systems engineering. </p>
</div>
<div id="governance">
      <hr>
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>A governance framework is important for any initiative involving many organizations, often with divergent interests and views. An agreed (generally, by member organizations) and documented governance framework ensures that the community hears and understands participants' views and interests. Governance delineates how and by whom decisions are taken. Example decisions include updates to the governance structure itself, Membership structure and fees, adjudicating conflicts, administrative support, starting new use case work, and providing funding and resources to projects in special cases when the community can’t provide funding and resources. </p>
      <p>The CodeX Accelerator provides the governance for use cases around cancer (and the <%= link_to("mCODE standard","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to start and to coordinate effectively across specialties.  </p>
      <p>The graphic below captures the CodeX governance structure as of 2024.  The tiered structure offers participation at different levels of responsibility and time commitment.  Details of the current <%= link_to("CodeX governance scheme","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Governance")%> can be found on their website.</p>

      <figure>
        <%= image_tag 'governance_structure.png', :width => '100%', :class => 'py-3', :alt=>"Block diagram of CodeX governance structure" %>
        <figcaption>Block diagram showing structure of CodeX governance, including Steering Committee, Operating Committee, Use Case Projects, and Community of Practice</figcaption>
      </figure>
  
      <p>A few points regarding CodeX Ggvernance: The elected steering committee makes major decisions including, governance structure, use cases, funding decisions, and moving projects into execution stage. The vast majority of all the community's volunteer resources are invested in the use case projects.  The community of Practice (near the bottom of the graphic) is open to the public and has been an effective feeder of new organizations and talents into CodeX membership and use cases.</p>
      <p>One key factor in CodeX's oncology work is the mCODE Executive Committee and its Technical Review Group (“External Expert Groups” circle on right). These groups provide clinical subject matter expertise across oncology fields and ensure the mCODE FHIR Implementation Guide is based on the most credible and recent clinical knowledge.</p>
      <p>A strategy for sustaining work is important. Communities cannot achieve success overnight. In CodeX, participants provide the range of skills and support necessary to drive each use case forward. Funding for overarching program management (near top of the graphic above) comes largely from membership fees (plus some volunteer effort). Based on 2024 CodeX Membership (<%= link_to("view current membership list","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership")%>) and Membership fee structure (<%= link_to("view current fee structure","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership+Options")%>) Membership fees provide about $800K (2024 USD) annually primarily for Program Management.</p>

</div>
<div id="growth">
      <hr>
      <h2>Community Growth</h2>
      <p>To advance use cases, the community needs a variety of organizations and skillsets  to establish  an overarching vision of adoption and real-world value. Thus, the community must be grown such that there are participants with direct experience related to each of the envisioned roles in the specialty initiative and its use cases.</p>
      <p>For example, in the CodeX Radiation Therapy Case Study, the team included participants from radiation therapy societies, health systems, payers, and vendors. Skillsets included clinical practice, radiation oncologists, radiation physicists, software engineers, informaticists, FHIR experts, HL7 standards process experts, and more. Getting the right set of people together at the right times in the process can be challenging. It is ideal to have redundancy among these roles, to bring in a diversity of experience and to provide forward momentum as participants cycle on and off the project. Champion leadership and collaboration as a committed and focused team is critical.</p>
      <p>The good news is that a promising use case has the potential to attract new participants. These participants appreciate the potential value of the work, are willing to invest resources to realize that value, and want to be at the table where decisions are made, and work is executed.</p>

<div id="value_prop">

    <h2>Value Propositions</h2>
      <p>To build a community of the diverse stakeholder groups needed for a standards initiative to succeed, it's important to understand and communicate the value propositions associated with each group. Further, it's helpful to think about value in two directions: (a) How can the standards initiative provide value to the stakeholder group?, and (b) How can the stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative? Below are value statements, looking in both directions, for six stakeholder groupings</p>

      <div class="community-growth-items">
      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Providers, Health Systems & Associated Specialty Societies</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to this stakeholder group?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
         <li> The resulting Use Cases and standards enable better care at lower cost (improved quality and speed, lower burden and expense).</li>
         <li>They empower shared decision-making between patients and providers.</li>
         <li>They enable valuable secondary uses (quality measure reporting, payer communications, research, etc.). </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can this stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>By representing, informing, and convincing a broad group of clinical constituents that this is important.
        <li>By committing experts who can provide deep clinical knowledge.</li>
        <li>Because they are  ustomers of vendors, from whom they can demand standards-based solutions.</li>
        <li>By finding and providing funding.</li>
      </ul>



      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Patients & Associated Advocate Societies</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to this stakeholder group?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Patients and caregivers feel the pain of the lack of standardized data (difficult to access and share between providers and caregivers, etc.), and the consequences of this gap (less optimal care, higher costs, confusion, mistakes, etc.).</li>
        <li>A common motto of CodeX work is that “every patient’s journey improves all future care”. </li>
        <li>Patient advocates can ensure patient centered care is at the forefront of developing core health data models and standards. </li>
        <li>Involvement of patients and advocates will translate to better care in the future, ensuring the continuum of care is enabled. </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can this stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>By representing, informing, and convincing a broad group of patients and caregivers.</li>
        <li>By providing the patient's perspective to ensure patient-centered approach.</li>
        <li>Patients are likely to increasingly demand the ability to collect, share, and control their health data (and thus motivate standards adoption)</li>
      </ul>
      

      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Regulators</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to this stakeholder group?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Work in standards initiatives can be aligned to support government rules, regulations, norms (e.g., USCDI, FHIR).</li>
        <li>Government agencies (ONC, etc.) have already recognized the value of work like CodeX and mCODE.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can this stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Government agencies issue rules/regulations regarding adoption of standards that could help propel specialty standards work.</li>
        <li>Many government agencies are part of other stakeholders.</li>
        <li>By providing funding</li>
      </ul>


      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Vendors (EHR and other health IT companies)</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to this stakeholder group? </p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Vendors are already enabling USCDI sharing via FHIR, and many are implementing mCODE and associated CodeX use case products</li>
        <li>Vendors can help align customer interests (fewer custom implementations)</li>
        <li>Vendors can provide input to ensure standards are implementable in their systems and consistent across specialties (cost effective development)</li>
        <li>Vendors who participate actively have a first mover advantage, move their products to market ahead of competitors</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can this stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?  </p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Will respond when many of their key customers ask for products based on standards</li>
        <li>Have ability to look across customers and across specialties and suggest ways to develop standards to optimize implementation and maintenance within systems</li>
      </ul>
      


      <!-- =========================================== -->

        <li>Improved automation to process actions more quickly, and even automatically (e.g., prior authorization, claims processing, etc.)</li>
        <li>Higher quality care, supported by standard data, will be informed by payers who are at the forefront of pay-for-value approaches to care </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can this stakeholder group provide value to the standards initiative?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>Can demand use of standards by associated health systems and vendors</li>
        <li>Potential funding</li>
      </ul>
      


      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Researchers</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">How can the standards initiative provide value to the stakeholder group?</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>More patient point-of-care data gathered and aggregated faster and with less expense for researchers (e.g., less curation)</li>
        <li>Substantial increases in speed, ease of execution, and cost-effectiveness through standardized data sharing across studies and institutions</li>
        <li>Potential funding</li>
      </ul>
