      <h1>Track 1. Community Building</h1>
      <p class="lead">Gathering the right organizations and people has been the most foundational and challenging track in the MITRE Interoperability Playbook.</p>
      <p>It’s very likely that almost everyone reviewing this site agrees that enabling true health data interoperability is more a social challenge, than a medical or technical challenge. It takes people who share a vision and mission, can align diverse views of how to get there, and invest the resources needed to change the status quo and gain sustainable growth and momentum. </p>

      <p>Actions that <%= link_to("CodeX","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> has found indispensable include (a) Engaging Champions, (b) Establishing Governance, (c) Growing the Community, and (d) Communicating Value Propositions that Enable Growth.  These actions are expanded upon below.</p>
<div id="champions">
      <h2>Champions</h2>
      <p>An essential first step when starting a new specialty initiative or starting a new Use Case within that initiative is for "Champions" to step-up to lead. In CodeX, successful Champions are organizations and individuals that:</p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li><b>Commit to lead</b> the initiative and/or Use Case</li>
        <li><b>Know</b> the challenges and opportunities (leading to potential Use Cases), organizations, people, and possibly-related initiatives within the larger specialty Community</li>
        <li><b>Command the attention</b> of a larger Community and can <b>influence</b> future users and stakeholders to engage</li>
        <li><b>Motivate implementation</b> of new standards into vendor solutions</li>
        <li><b>Motivate the changes in health processes</b> needed to use and benefit from of the standards-based systems </li>
        <li><b>Attract the resources</b> needed to succeed</li>
        <li><b>Drive</b> one more key tracks of the initiative and/or Use Case: Community Engagement, Use Case Prioritization, Standards Development, Implementation & Pilots, Adoption & Value</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Champions and all who actively participate will most likely understand the challenges for which standards-based data interoperability provide substantial benefits. They'll have or develop a shared vision for a future where patient data can be collected once, and then used with no or little manipulation for many Use Cases around patient care, research and other applications.</p>
      <p>It's clear that Champions have significant responsibilities.  But they also realize future benefits in terms of prioritizing Use Cases, defining direction, achieving objectives, and ultimately improving health care and research within their organizations and across the landscape. </p>
      <p>Large, medical professional societies and Government organizations have been the most frequent CodeX Use Case Champions, but other stakeholders have also been effective Champions. The founding Champions for the overall CodeX initiative (which started by addressing challenges in oncology) were <%= link_to("American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)","https://www.asco.org") %>, with reach to all oncologists and centers; and <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %>, with deep expertise in convening, FHIR standards and systems engineering. </p>
</div>
<div id="governance">
      <hr>
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>A Governance and organizational framework is important for any initiative involving many organizations, often with divergent interests and views. An agreed (generally, by member organizations) and documented Governance framework ensures that views and interests are heard and understood. Governance documents how and by whom decisions are taken. Example decisions include updates to the Governance structure itself, Membership structure and fees, adjudicating conflicts, administrative support, starting new Use Case work, and providing funding and resources to projects in special cases when the Community can’t provide funding and resources. </p>
      <p>The CodeX Accelerator provides the Governance for Use Cases around cancer (and the <%= link_to("mCODE standard","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other Governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to start and to coordinate effectively across specialties.  </p>
      <p>The graphic below captures the CodeX Governance structure as of 2024.  The tiered structure offers participation at different of levels of responsibility and time commitment.  Details of the current <%= link_to("CodeX Governance scheme can be found on their website.","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Governance")%></p>

      <figure>
        <%= image_tag 'governance_structure.png', :width => '100%', :class => 'py-3', :alt=>"Block diagram of CodeX Governance structure" %>
        <figcaption>Block diagram showing structure of CodeX Governance, including Steering Committee, Operating Committee, Use Case projectrs, and Community of Practice</figcaption>
      </figure>
  
      <p>A few points regarding CodeX Governance: Major decisions (Governance structure, moving Use Cases into the execution stage, funding for Project Management and Use Cases, etc.) are made by the elected Steering Committee. The vast majority of all of the Community's volunteer resources are invested in the Use Case projects.  The Community of Practice (near the bottom of the graphic) is open to the public and has been an effective feeder of new organizations and talents into CodeX membership and Use Cases.</p>
      <p>One of the key “External Expert Groups” (circle on right) for CodeX's oncology work is the mCODE Executive Committee and its Technical Review Group. These groups provide clinical subject matter expertise across oncology fields and ensure the mCODE FHIR Implementation Guide is based on the most credible and recent clinical knowledge.</p>
      <p>A strategy for sustaining work is important.  Success is not achieved overnight. In CodeX, the range of skills (and sometimes money) needed to drive each Use Case is almost always provided by participants. Funding for overarching Program Management (near top of the graphic above) comes largely from Membership fees (plus some volunteer effort). Based on 2024 CodeX Membership (<%= link_to("view current membership list","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership")%>) and Membership fee structure (<%= link_to("view current fee structure","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Membership+Options")%>) Membership fees provide about $800K (2024 USD) annually primarily for Program Management.</p>

</div>
<div id="growth">
      <hr>
      <h2>Community Growth</h2>
      <p>For Use Case projects to progress from a vision to adoption and value in the real world, a variety of organizations and skillsets are needed. Thus, the Community must be grown such that there are participants with direct experience related to each of the envisioned roles in the specialty initiative and its Use Cases.</p>
      <p>For example, in the CodeX Radiation Therapy Case Study, the team included participants from radiation therapy societies, health systems, payers, and vendors. Skillsets included clinical practice, radiation oncologists, radiation physicists, software engineers, informaticists, FHIR experts, HL7 standards process experts, and more. Getting the right set of people together at the right times in the process can be challenging. It’s ideal to have redundancy among these roles, to bring in a diversity of experience and in case some people have to reduce their effort. Jelling as a committed and focused team is critical. Leadership of Champions is key.</p>
      <p>The good news is that a promising Use Case has the potential to attract new participants. These participants appreciate the potential value of the work, are willing to invest resources to realize that value, and want to be at the table where decisions are made and work is executed.</p>

<div id="value_prop">
    <hr>
    <h2>Value Propositions</h2>
      <p>CodeX experience suggests that different value propositions often resonate with different stakeholders. The following generalizes, for six different groupings of stakeholders: (a) <b>the value to a specialty data standardization initiative</b> for each stakeholder's involvement, and (b) the <b>value to each stakeholder</b> for investing their resources in a specialty data standardization initiative.  These value propositions are, of course, critical to the <%= link_to("future adoption and value of the future standards within the health community", "adoption.html#adoption") %>. </p>
