              The RTTD CodeX use case developed, implemented, tested and is driving adoption of FHIR-based standards and systems such that (a) radiation oncology information systems can seamlessly generate and share patients' radiation therapy treatment summary information across health systems and providers, and (b) clinicians can then use the radiation therapy treatment summary information to make informed, impactful decisions related to a patient's health.

              Learn how streamlining transitions of care and care coordination through FHIR changed post-acute care.
            </p>
            <p>
            The PACIO (Post-Acute Care InterOperability) Project is all about care coordination â€“ Forty-five percent of Medicare patients who leave hospitals go into some kind of post-acute care. Post-acute care accounts for $74 billion in Medicare payments annually, so it is a large part of our healthcare system. Post-acute care patients are typically very complex and have multiple transitions in their healthcare journey.  When a person transitions between healthcare settings, including ambulatory care, acute care, long-term post-acute care (LTPAC), and home- and community-based services (HCBS) &mdash; their care is often fragmented and can lead to poor health outcomes, increased burden, and increased costs.  The PACIO Project is helping to fix these problems.
